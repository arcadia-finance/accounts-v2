/**
 * @title An Arcadia Account used to deposit a combination of all kinds of assets
 * @author Pragma Labs
 * @notice Users can use this Account to deposit assets (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, ...).
 * The Account will denominate all the pooled assets into one baseCurrency (one unit of account, like usd or eth).
 * An increase of value of one asset will offset a decrease in value of another asset.
 * Users can take out a credit line against the single denominated value.
 * Ensure your total value denomination remains above the liquidation threshold, or risk being liquidated!
 * @dev A Account is a smart contract that will contain multiple assets.
 * Using getValue(<baseCurrency>), the Account returns the combined total value of all (whitelisted) assets the Account contains.
 * Integrating this Account as means of collateral management for your own protocol that requires collateral is encouraged.
 * Arcadia's Account functions will guarantee you a certain value of the Account.
 * For whitelists or liquidation strategies specific to your protocol, contact: dev at arcadia.finance
